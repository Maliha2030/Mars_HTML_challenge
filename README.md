## Mars_HTML_challenge
#  Web-scraping and data analysis project

Through identifying HTML elements on a web-page, identifying their id and class attributes, I utilise this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. In this challenge I will be web-scraping from Mars News and analysing Mars Weather Data.
